title: About Project
content:
  - description: Our research project focuses on the assembly and exploration of genomes, specifically Metagenome-Assembled Genomes (MAGs).
  - description: We employ state-of-the-art computational tools and methodologies to extract valuable insights from complex genetic data.
  - description: Genomes serve as the blueprint of life, containing vital information about an organism's characteristics, functions, & evolutionary history.
  - description: By assembling genomes from metagenomic data, we gain insights into the diverse microbial communities present in various environments, from oceans to soil to human microbiomes.
  - description: Understanding these genomes can shed light on crucial ecological interactions, potential applications in biotechnology, and even human health.
